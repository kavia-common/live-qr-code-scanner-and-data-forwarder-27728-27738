Body: {"url": "https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/kc29p81u69pouhsdkr6d4/2023-Conference-Trade-Show-Interview-Series-Part-2.mp4?rlkey=qzevjngye7q4g15mhw9uwh0lm&dl=0", "frame_stride": 1, "max_frames": 500, "preprocess": {"grayscale": true, "adaptive_threshold": true, "denoise": true}}

Response:
Status: 500
Body: {"detail":"Failed to process video URL: Unable to open downloaded/streamed video with OpenCV"}

Interpretation:
- /process_video endpoint is reachable.
- The video could not be opened by OpenCV after download/stream.
- No QR codes were detected; frames scanned likely 0.
- Root cause likely a non-direct/unsupported Dropbox URL or unsupported container format/sizing for cv2.VideoCapture.
