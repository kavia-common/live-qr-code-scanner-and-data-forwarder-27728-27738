POST https://vscode-internal-24781-beta.beta01.cloud.kavia.ai:3001/process_youtube
Body: {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pUQsYy6IdZk"}

Response:
Status: 500
Body: {"detail":"Failed to process YouTube video: HTTP Error 400: Bad Request"}

Interpretation:
- The backend returned HTTP 500 with detail indicating an underlying HTTP 400 error while attempting to process the YouTube URL.
- This suggests the YouTube retrieval via pytube failed (e.g., Shorts format restrictions, regional/network restrictions, or pytube encountering a transient/format-specific error).
- As a result, QR code detection did not proceed. No QR codes were detected from this attempt.
